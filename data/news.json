      "summary": "The Union Cabinet approved the Unified Pension Scheme (UPS) for central government employees, guaranteeing assured pension equal to 50% of average basic pay drawn over the last 12 months of service for those with minimum 25 years of service. The scheme, effective from April 1, 2025, provides a minimum pension of \u20b910,000 per month after 10 years of service and includes inflation indexation similar to the Old Pension Scheme. Family pension will be 60% of employee pension, and the scheme offers lump sum payment at superannuation along with gratuity. The decision addresses long-standing demands from employee unions who opposed the New Pension Scheme introduced in 2004. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman explained that UPS combines the benefits of both old and new pension schemes while maintaining fiscal sustainability. The scheme will benefit approximately 23 lakh central government employees and 30 lakh pensioners. State governments are expected to adopt similar frameworks for their employees [...]",

      "summary": "Researchers at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) Bangalore developed an artificial intelligence system capable of detecting multiple cancer types with 95% accuracy using simple blood tests, potentially revolutionizing early cancer diagnosis. The AI model, trained on data from over 100,000 patients, can identify biomarkers for lung, breast, colorectal, and prostate cancers from liquid biopsies months before conventional imaging methods. The breakthrough technology uses machine learning algorithms to analyze circulating tumor DNA and protein patterns in blood samples, making cancer screening accessible and affordable. Clinical trials conducted across 15 hospitals showed remarkable success in detecting stage-1 cancers, significantly improving treatment outcomes and survival rates. The Department of Biotechnology announced plans to commercialize the technology through public-private partnerships, with initial deployment in government hospitals by 2025. International pharmaceutical companies have expressed interest in licensing the technology for global distribution.
