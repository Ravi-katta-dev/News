      "title": "IIT Bombay Creates Artificial Photosynthesis System Producing Hydrogen at Industrial Scale",
      "summary": "Researchers at IIT Bombay achieved a revolutionary breakthrough on August 22, 2025, by developing an artificial photosynthesis system capable of producing hydrogen at industrial scale using only sunlight and water. The system, led by Prof. Rohit Srivastava, mimics natural photosynthesis with 40% efficiency, significantly higher than existing technologies. The breakthrough utilizes novel perovskite-based photocatalysts and advanced light-harvesting complexes to split water molecules. \"This technology could revolutionize clean hydrogen production,\" stated IIT Bombay Director Prof. Subhasis Chaudhuri. The pilot plant produces 1000 kg of hydrogen daily using 10 hectares of solar collectors, with plans for commercial deployment by 2027. The system operates at ambient temperature and pressure, eliminating energy-intensive electrolysis processes. Reliance Industries announced ₹5,000 crore investment to scale the technology for green hydrogen production. International Energy Agency recognized the breakthrough as potentially game-changing for global hydrogen economy. The technology promises hydrogen production costs below $1 per kg, making it competitive with fossil fuels [...]",
